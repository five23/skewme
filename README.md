## Browser plugin for models &amp; actors to flag and remove unauthorized content with 1-click.

### Goals

- Give models more power than the photographers
- Give exploited individuals a way to remove content with 1-click such that the changes propagate across networks. Very often these videos shared by angry ex-es get posted to dozens of platforms and it becomes nearly impossible to remove. This is a very hard problem. Suggestions welcome and needed.
